# Breast_Cancer_Prediction

Building a breast cancer classification neural network in Python using libraries like TensorFlow/Keras. Preprocess the data, splitting it into training and testing sets. Design a neural network model with input layer, hidden layers, and output layer for binary classification. and evaluate its performance to predict malignant or benign tumors with high accuracy.
